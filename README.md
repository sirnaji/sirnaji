## ðŸŽ€ ME
I am a 3D Artist at Hot Toaster *(but we aren't working on a project currently!)*, but also a developer.
I learned to program with Python, but quickly switched to a front-end web developer for a while.  

For the past 2 years I've mostly done some small backend services using Nodejs *(but recently moved to **[Deno](https://deno.land)** and **Typescript**)*.

I am currently trying to learn Rust. It's very complicated because I never really learned to program before, I used exclusively Javascript and I did a lot of things without thinking about doing things properly. But I am having fun.   
I will only use it on small, very simple tools for the moment, and I will continue to use typescript for more or less large projects to be faster for now.


## âœ¨ PROJECTS
Not much to see here at the moment, most of my projects are private.   
I am still working on some stuff that may - or may not - show up here soon though!

Also, here are my super-duper git stats! I love stats.
