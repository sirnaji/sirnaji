## ðŸŽ€ Hi, I'm naji!
I am a 3D Artist at Hot Toaster *(but we aren't working on a project currently!)*, but also a developer.
I learned to program with Python, but quickly switched to a front-end web developer for a while.  
For the past 2 years I've mostly done some small backend services using **Deno** *(https://deno.land)[deno.land] and Typescript.
Later this year, I want to gradually learn Rust by using it on very small projects to get the rig.

## âœ¨ My projects
Not much to see here at the moment, unfortunately most of my projects are rather very simple so useless to be shown to the world, or so bad that I'm too ashamed to show them publicly.
I am still working on some stuff that might - or might not - show up here soon though!

Also, here are my super-duper git stats! I love stats.
