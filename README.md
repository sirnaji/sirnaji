<h2>🎀 Hi, I'm naji!</h2>

  Hobbyist developer and 3D Artist at Hot Toaster, tho I cannot link you anything regarding this yet <br/>
  Used to toy around with Python in the past, i've been using **nodejs** (+ Typescript) the last 2 years. I plan to learn **Rust** or **Go** later this year. <br/>

<h2>✨ My projects</h2>

<p align="justify">
  Not much to see here at the moment, most of my projects aren't clean or useful enough to be open source yet.
  I am working on some stuff that may - or may not - appear here later
