## ABOUT ME

Hi, I am najimi or naji for short.   
I am a 3D Artist at Hot Toaster, but twe have yet to release a game.   

But you can imagine that with this GitHub page, I am also a developer. I'm not the strongest in the field, but I like it.   
I started by making sites in php/html/css. I hated php. I loved css.   
But now I mainly develop small backend tools, like APIs or servers for very simple small games (Luo).   

I mainly use Typescript, sometimes but very rarely Python for small simple scripts.   
I'm learning Rust recently, I find it hard but I have fun making some tools with it.

## MY PROJECTS

Not much to see here at the moment, most of my projects are private.   
I am still working on some stuff that may - or may not - show up here soon though!

Also, here are my super-duper git stats! I love stats.
